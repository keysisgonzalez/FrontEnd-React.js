Welcome to my React Frontend Components Repository! Here you'll find a collection of handy React components I've built for different frontend applications. From user authentication features like login and registration to displaying friends' cards, soccer player cards with filtering, and a movies application for browsing, adding, and editing movies, these components cover a range of needs. They've helped me simplify my frontend development process, and I hope they'll be just as useful for you too!
